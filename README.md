# Media Library

---

A Spring Boot application designed to manage a personal collection of books, games, movies and series.\
It supports CRUD operations across four tables, allowing users to add, update and remove records.\
The backend uses Spring Boot with JPA for ORM and a relational database (PostgreSQL),\
while the frontend, with a simple built using Thymeleaf, provides an intuitive\
user interface for seamless interaction with the media library.
